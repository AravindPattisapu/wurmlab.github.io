# Joining the lab

We are always eager for smart & motivated people to come and work with us. The [Organismal Biology department](http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk) at QMUL includes many other behavioral and evolutionary genomics researchers; we share a cutting edge laboratory for genomics work and a powerful computing environment. [We are located](/map) in east london, with many of us living locally (Hackney, Bow) - a 15 minute walk to 20 minute bicycle ride from the office.

If you're interested in joining us, please provide by email a CV, and a short proposal. Projects should adress major evolutionary or ecologically relevant questions, and/or major challenges in bioinformatics/genomics. We are happy for projects to include population genomics, comparative analyses, bioinformatics, molecular biology, software development, hacking, field or behavioral work.

## Postdocs

We invite applications for Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie fellowships. The biggest effort is usually to come up with a good project. Once a proposal is written it is often worth applying to several funding sources. 

These can include:
 * many national sources of funding (e.g., Swiss NSF, [Fondation Fyssen](http://www.fondationfyssen.fr/), [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/))
 * EMBO
 * putting together a BBSRC or NERC grant with you as a named researcher co-investigator.
 * FEBS

## PhD positions

PhD funding exists as part of multiple schemes. These include:

 * RCUK Doctoral training programmes - application deadlines in January.
    * [London NERC Doctoral Training Programme](http://london-nerc-dtp.org)
    * [BBSRC London Interdisciplinary Doctoral Programme](http://lido-dtp.ac.uk) - 

 * In some circumstances we accept self-funded PhD candidates.
 * Many national schemes exist (e.g., from your country of origin). Some of these are listed [on QMUL's page](http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/index.html) including:
    * CONACYT (Mexico)
    * Commonwealth Scholarships
    * Newton fund
 * Occasionally, we have specific funding for PhD positions.

Please get in touch if you want to put in an application.

## Internships

We can in some cases host interns. This is much easier if you come with your own funding. Minimal duration is 5 months.

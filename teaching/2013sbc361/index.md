## Whoops the address has changed

The directory `2013stats` was renamed to `2013sbc361`. So you may need to manually edit the address you are looking for.

You may be looking for one of the following:

* [reptile_data.txt](reptile_data.txt)
* [introtoprogramminginR/index.html](introtoprogramminginR)
* [introtoprogramminginRpart2/index.html](introtoprogramminginRpart2)

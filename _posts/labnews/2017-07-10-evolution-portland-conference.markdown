The [Evolution meeting](http://www.evolutionmeetings.org/) took place this June in Portland, Oregon. Organised every year, it is a great conference supported by the Society for the Study of Evolution, the Society of Systematic Biologists, and the American Society of Naturalists.

The Wurmlab travelled there to hear about current research on evolutionary biology. Creating their schedule from an incredibly rich program of up to 13 parallel sessions, Natalia and [Emeline](team/efavreau/index.html) caught up with the latest on social systems, genomics and evolutionary stories. They also participated in the conference:

* Emeline presented the results of her first year of PhD on the genomics of the socially polymorphic ant species *Pheidole pallidula*
* Natalia gave a talk on the DNA methylation on bees. This was the final presentation before her PhD viva. We are very happy to congratulate her on successfully defending her thesis - congratulations Dr Natalia Araujo!

The meeting was a wonderful occasion to catch up with collaborators and presenting the Wurmlab research to this (mainly) North American audience. Next year, Evolution will join [ESEB in Montpellier (France)](http://www.eseb2017.nl/), for a joint meeting.

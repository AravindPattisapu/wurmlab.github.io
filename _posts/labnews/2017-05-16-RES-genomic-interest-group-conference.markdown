Three of us attended the Insect Genomics Interest Group meeting, organised by the [Royal Entomological Society](http://www.royensoc.co.uk/). The event took place on the 16th May 2017, at the Rothamsted Research Centre.

The speakers to this event included highly relevant researchers from all over the world, covering a wide range of subjects in insect genomics, from pest control to evolutionary biology. Of course the Wurmlab could not miss this chance and [Carlos Martinez-Ruiz](/team/cmartinezruiz/index.html), Joe Colgan and [Anurag Priyam](/team/priyam/index.html) attended the event to disseminate our research:

* Joe gave a talk on the signatures of positive selection in the genomes of bumblebees (*Bombus terrestris*) from populations around the UK
* Carlos presented the preliminary results of his PhD project on the signatures of evolutionary conflict in the transcriptome of the fire ant *Solenopsis invicta*
* Priyam presented a poster on the bionformatic tools SequenceServer and GeneValidator, of which he is co-developer

The meeting was very fruitful, and offered exciting oportunities for collaborations between the Wurmlab and other researchers from institutions in the UK and abroad.

We look forward to the next meeting!

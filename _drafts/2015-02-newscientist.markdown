Several points came up in multiple New Scientist articles:

 * What is a paragraph? In new scientist type articles they are designed for shorter attention spans and thus likely to be shorter than in a normal essay or scientific article. 
 * Avoid doubles/Redundancies for example "New advances in improving medical treatments" is is a triple statement: improvement and advances are both already new!! Instead use:  "Improvements in medical treatments"
 * The New Scientist format is special:
    - a catchy title
    - a catchy opening paragraph. It is worth fully writing out several and retaining the one works best
    - you should weave the reader through your story
    - perhaps include some quotes
    - make the reader think about the bigger picture
    - entertain the reader in addition to informing them
    - once you have a good "finished" version think carefully about the format and question what can you do to get closer to a new scientist article

For all of your stuff:

 * make sure you pay careful attention to any details (punctuation, formatting). 
 * **some people had *major* grammar issues. You can overcome this. Millions of scientists have (most scientists didn't grow up speaking english at home). And you should make it your priority to overcome grammar issues ASAP because incorrect grammar will hurt your end-of-year essays, your cover letters for future job recruitment etc.  Check Strunk & White's "The Elements of Style".  (mentioned on my web page). **
 * Consider carefully if the text you are writing is necessary (is it within the aim of the essay/dissertaion/article or does it distract from it?)

The most important aspect for the dissertations is:
 * **to consider each of your sections/paragraphs is relevant to the aim of the dissertation.**

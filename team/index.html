about: I’m currently interested in evolutionary comparative genomics and genetics in social Hymenoptera and the mechanisms underlying evolution of genomes, chromosomes, genes, gene networks, behavior, castes and sociality.
By developing novel molecular markers, constructing a dense genetic linkage map for the bumblebee Bombus terrestris and comparing it with the honeybee Apis mellifera, we could show that both species show a high degree of conservation of the genomic architecture. Such a high proportion of synteny and homology (rearranged region on the same linkage group) between both species is particular unexpected, as both species show a very high genome-wide recombination rate, comparable short generation times and a divergence time of about 100 million years. Species with similar divergence times (e.g. mouse and human) show extensive reshuffling of chromosomal segments and high numbers of inter-chromosomal rearrangements. Thus our study reveals a slow genome and chromosome evolution in the Apidae, which might be related to some life history traits such as haplo-diploidy or sociality. The linkage map will also support efforts to assemble the Bombus terrestris genome sequence, in whose annotation we will be involved.
Using a novel approach detecting conserved SSRs in multiple genomes we not only could show, that SSRs can be conserved over several hundred million years across insect genomes, but also showed the influence of generation time in comparision of rates of genome evolution. Our data suggest that indeed the genomes of (socia)l Hymenoptera evolve at much faster rate than those of Diptera. Furthermore we used conserved SSRs as homologous markers to compare chromosomal structures. We first revealed major assembly problems by evaluating two bumblebee genomes, and, after fixing those assembly problems, could show, that the two genomes underwent a remarkably low number of rearrangements despite their several million years of separate evolution. This further supports our earlier finding, that genomic architecture seems to be somewhat conserved in social bees.
Other repetitive elements were detected and mined from 10 different bee genomes and were used to find genomic signatures of social evolution
Furthermore I’m interested in genetic processes underlying caste differences (differential expression, methylation ...) in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris and honeybee (Apis mellifera), especially the cape honeybee A. m. capensis. After whole genome sequences of several bee species (including Bombus terrestris), both social and non-social, as well as for Polistes paper wasps and several ant species become available, comparative approaches will be very promising to characterize the evolutionary signatures of sociality within genomes.
I'm also involved in the the national network project on honeybee diseases and host-parasite interactions "FITBEE" for which I'm developing a PCR based assay to detect honeybee pathogens. This assay is highly optimized for time- and cost-efficiency using highly multiplexed reactions.
Within upcoming PostDoc Projects (DAAD, Marie Curie) I will work also on different aspects of chromosome and genome evolution in fireants (Solenopsis) in relation to different social organisations of colonies.</b>
